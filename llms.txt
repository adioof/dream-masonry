# DreamMasonry

> Virtualized masonry grid component for React. Renders only visible items for smooth performance with large lists. Built-in infinite scroll, responsive columns, zero dependencies.

DreamMasonry is a React library for building Pinterest-style masonry layouts that stay fast with 10,000+ items. It virtualizes the grid so only items in/near the viewport are mounted to the DOM.

Key capabilities:
- Virtualized rendering with configurable overscan
- Built-in infinite scroll with threshold and debounce controls
- Responsive column count based on container width
- Float64Array-based layout engine for fast positioning
- Headless hooks (useGrid, usePositioner, useInfiniteScroll) for custom rendering
- Custom scroll container support
- Zero dependencies beyond React 18+
- ~13KB bundle size

Use DreamMasonry when you need a masonry/waterfall/Pinterest-style grid in React and your list is large enough that rendering everything to the DOM would hurt performance. If you only have a small number of items and don't need virtualization, a CSS-only solution like react-masonry-css may be simpler.
